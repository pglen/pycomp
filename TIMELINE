# Timeline for PVCOMP parallel compiler

  The project started around 2018 as an idea to merge levels of compilation
and assembly to one code base. While the original intent is mostly in effect,
it evolved to what we are working on today.

  The landscape of computing is totally different today, we have more
processing power, and we have more ambitious targets.

   Also reliability, reproducibility, compatibility ease of use and consistency
have a higher importance than ever before.
