<h1>Timeline for PVCOMP parallel compiler</h1>
<p>The project started around 2018 as an idea to merge levels of compilation<br />
and assembly to one code base. While the original intent is mostly in effect,<br />
it evolved to what we are working on today.</p>
<p>The landscape of computing is totally different today, we have more<br />
processing power, and we have more ambitious targets.</p>
<p>Also reliability, reproducibility, compatibility ease of use and consistency<br />
have a higher importance than ever before.</p>
